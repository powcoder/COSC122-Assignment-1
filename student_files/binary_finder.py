    You can assume the stolen list will be in ascending order.
    You must assume that the sighted list is unsorted.

    The returned list contains stolen number plates that were sighted,
    in the same order as they appeared in the sighted list.
    The integer is the number of NumberPlate comparisons that
    were made.

    You can assume that each input list contains only unique plates,
    ie, neither list will contain more than one copy of any given plate.
    This fact will be very helpful in some special cases - you should
    think about when you can stop searching.    

    Note: you shouldn't alter either of the provided lists and you
    shouldn't make copies of either provided list.
